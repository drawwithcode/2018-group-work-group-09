        <span class="span1" >You are floating in a simulation of the Universe!</span>

        <span class="span2">Design your own planetary system and learn more about how things move up here! To create your planets KEEP PRESS YOUR MOUSE.</span>

        <span class="span3">What can you notice?</span>

        <span class="span4">Kepler's laws say that planets move slower when they’re farther from the Sun. Keep that in mind! </span>

        <span class="span5">Take your time, and than upload your galaxy by PRESSING THE SPACEBAR.</span>

        <!--        Texts that appears after the uploading with the spacebar-->

        <span class="span6">Done! You are in the real Universe now!</span>

        <span class="span7">Ehi, why your system is so fast? This is bizarre! There isn't even enough mass for this velocity! It looks like your planets don’t like Kepler’s law! Or maybe there’s something missing here...</span>

        <span class="span8">... Something you can’t see with your eyes. COVER THE WEBCAM to explore the invisible!</span>

        <!--        Text that appears after webcam covered -->

        <span class="span9">Also Vera Rubin noticed this anomaly in the speed's behavior.</span>

        <span class="span10">The only explanation is that there must be DARK MATTER contribuiting to the gravity and there must be a lot of it and it is everywhere! She calculated that it accounts for about 85% of matter in the Universe against 15% of visible matter.</span>
